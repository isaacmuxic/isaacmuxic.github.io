This is a self host front end example of running the "main-app.py" in my "matchering" fork. github.io hosting has problem with flutter/dart/dio it will not run properly.

For self hosting, Replace the "url" field in assets/assets/config.json with your actual hosting of the matchering back-end "main-app.py" in my fork "https://github.com/isaacmuxic/matchering"
